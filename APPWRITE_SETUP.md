   - Click "Update"

2. **Configure Google OAuth**
   - Go to "Auth" ‚Üí "Providers"
   - Click on "Google" provider
   - Enable the provider
   - You'll need to create a Google OAuth app:
     - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
     - Create a new project or select existing one
     - Enable Google+ API
     - Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
     - Set application type to "Web application"
     - Add authorized redirect URIs:
       - `https://sfo.cloud.appwrite.io/v1/account/sessions/oauth2/callback/google/68b9bee9001f5ef30aab`
       - For development: `http://localhost:3000` (optional)
     - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
   - Paste the Client ID and Client Secret in Appwrite
   - Click "Update"

3. **Configure GitHub OAuth**
   - Go to "Auth" ‚Üí "Providers"
   - Click on "GitHub" provider
   - Enable the provider
   - You'll need to create a GitHub OAuth app:

     - Click "Register application"
     - Copy the Client ID and generate a Client Secret
   - Paste the Client ID and Client Secret in Appwrite
   - Click "Update"

4. **Configure Auth Settings**
   - Go to "Auth" ‚Üí "Settings"
   - Set "Session Length" to 30 days (or your preference)
   - Enable "Email Verification" if desired
   - Save settings

## üîß Step 4: Update Environment Variables

1. **Update `.env.local` file**
   ```bash
   # Appwrite Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-actual-database-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=expenses
   ```

2. **Replace the placeholder values:**
   - `your-actual-project-id`: Your project ID from Step 1
   - `your-actual-database-id`: Your database ID from Step 2
   - The collection ID should be `expenses` as we created it

## üöÄ Step 5: Test the Application

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Authentication**
   - Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Click "Login" or "Get Started"
   - Try creating a new account
   - Try logging in with existing credentials

3. **Test Expense Management**
   - After logging in, try adding expenses
   - Edit and delete expenses
   - Check if data persists after page refresh

## üîç Step 6: Verify Data in Appwrite

1. **Check Database**
   - Go to your Appwrite project dashboard
   - Navigate to "Databases" ‚Üí "expense_tracker_db" ‚Üí "expenses"
   - You should see your expense records

2. **Check Users**
   - Go to "Auth" ‚Üí "Users"
   - You should see registered users

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Project not found" error**
   - Verify your `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` is correct
   - Make sure the project is active in Appwrite console

2. **"Database not found" error**
   - Verify your `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID` is correct
   - Check if the database exists in your project

3. **"Collection not found" error**
   - Verify your `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID` is set to `expenses`
   - Check if the collection exists in your database

4. **Authentication errors**
   - Make sure email/password authentication is enabled
   - Check if the user account exists in Appwrite

5. **Permission denied errors**
   - Verify collection permissions are set correctly
   - Make sure users have read/write access

6. **OAuth errors**
   - Verify redirect URIs are correctly configured in Google/GitHub
   - Check that Client ID and Client Secret are correct
   - Ensure the OAuth provider is enabled in Appwrite
   - Make sure the redirect URI includes your actual project ID

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are loaded correctly
3. **Check Appwrite console** for any error logs
4. **Test with a simple API call** to verify connection
